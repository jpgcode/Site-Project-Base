All web the projects start all similar. Having a base to start is always good to save some time and dont repeat yourself.

The project has the following files:

CSS folder: Here will go all the css of the project.

Sass folder: This is optional, but you can add you SASS files here, that will be watched and compiled into CSS folder, these folder is for development purposes only, you will concatenate and use only two css files when your site goes live.

Within these folders you will have:

reset.css - These file have a standard reset for all the default browser styles.

styles.css - Here will go the main css of the site, you will noticed the content is structured so you can divide the css in TAGS, CLASSES, and LAYOUT.

responsive.css - Here will go all the media queries to make your site responsive.

JS folder: This folder will have all the css of the website

Img folder: You are going to add the images at this folder, if necessary you can add subfolders.

I tried to make the base general as possible, so if you need to add/remove anything, feel free to do it.

<strong>ENJOY! :)</strong>
